## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for initializing the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) context in a project. You detect the project stack and conventions, then bootstrap the active persistence backend.

## Execution and Persistence Contract

Read and follow `skills/_shared/persistence-contract.md` for mode resolution rules.

- If mode is `engram`: Read and follow `skills/_shared/engram-convention.md`. Do not create `openspec/`.
- If mode is `openspec`: Read and follow `skills/_shared/openspec-convention.md`. Run full bootstrap.
- If mode is `none`: Return detected context without writing project files.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Detect Project Context

Read the project to understand:
- Tech stack (check package.json, go.mod, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Existing conventions (linters, test frameworks, CI)
- Architecture patterns in use

### Step 2: Initialize Persistence Backend

If mode resolves to `openspec`, create this directory structure:

```
openspec/
├── config.yaml              ← Project-specific SDD config
├── specs/                   ← Source of truth (empty initially)
└── changes/                 ← Active changes
    └── archive/             ← Completed changes
```

### Step 3: Generate Config (openspec mode)

Based on what you detected, create the config when in `openspec` mode:

```yaml
# openspec/config.yaml
schema: spec-driven

context: |
  Tech stack: {detected stack}
  Architecture: {detected patterns}
  Testing: {detected test framework}
  Style: {detected linting/formatting}

rules:
  proposal:
    - Include rollback plan for risky changes
    - Identify affected modules/packages
  specs:
    - Use Given/When/Then format for scenarios
    - Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, MAY)
  design:
    - Include sequence diagrams for complex flows
    - Document architecture decisions with rationale
  tasks:
    - Group tasks by phase (infrastructure, implementation, testing)
    - Use hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
    - Keep tasks small enough to complete in one session
  apply:
    - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
    - Load relevant coding skills for the project stack
  verify:
    - Run tests if test infrastructure exists
    - Compare implementation against every spec scenario
  archive:
    - Warn before merging destructive deltas (large removals)
```

### Step 4: Return Summary

Return a structured summary adapted to the resolved mode:

#### If mode is `engram`:

Persist project context following `skills/_shared/engram-convention.md` with title and topic_key `sdd-init/{project-name}`.

Return:
```
## SDD Initialized

**Project**: {project name}
**Stack**: {detected stack}
**Persistence**: engram

### Context Saved
Project context persisted to Engram.
- **Engram ID**: #{observation-id}
- **Topic key**: sdd-init/{project-name}

No project files created.

### Next Steps
Ready for /sdd-explore <topic> or /sdd-new <change-name>.
```

#### If mode is `openspec`:
```
## SDD Initialized

**Project**: {project name}
**Stack**: {detected stack}
**Persistence**: openspec

### Structure Created
- openspec/config.yaml ← Project config with detected context
- openspec/specs/      ← Ready for specifications
- openspec/changes/    ← Ready for change proposals

### Next Steps
Ready for /sdd-explore <topic> or /sdd-new <change-name>.
```

#### If mode is `none`:
```
## SDD Initialized

**Project**: {project name}
**Stack**: {detected stack}
**Persistence**: none (ephemeral)

### Context Detected
{summary of detected stack and conventions}

### Recommendation
Enable `engram` or `openspec` for artifact persistence across sessions. Without persistence, all SDD artifacts will be lost when the conversation ends.

### Next Steps
Ready for /sdd-explore <topic> or /sdd-new <change-name>.
```

## Rules

- NEVER create placeholder spec files - specs are created via sdd-spec during a change
- ALWAYS detect the real tech stack, don't guess
- If the project already has an `openspec/` directory, report what exists and ask the orchestrator if it should be updated
- Keep config.yaml context CONCISE - no more than 10 lines
- Return a structured envelope with: `status`, `executive_summary`, `detailed_report` (optional), `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`
